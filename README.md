### Starter Pack
1. Setup your virtual environment and install all the packages needed by running "pip3  -r install requirements.txt".
2. Also setup a .env file and configure with all the necessary environment variables e.g. "SECRET_KEY".
3. Create a new branch before adding a new feature or changes to any existing feature by running "git checkout -b new branch name". You should also run "git pull" to make sure the new branch is updated with the latest version of the remote origin.
4. After running all the test and the feature or code is working as expected, ensure to fill the pull request template in the .github folder to document the changes implemented before pushing to github.

### Things to do
* Create a new branch
* Git pull
* Create virtual environment
* Install dependencies
